march 9, 2019 code review

+ Description of code at a high level.
    - At the top of the file one should be informed of the code's mission statement.

    fn screen_shot
+ double include "use std::io::prelude::*" line 11.
+ used twice but included locally gdi32::CreateCompatibleDC,
+ line 85 is not used gdi32::GetObjectA
+ line 101 if bitmap_handle  is bad we should exit fn screen_shot
+ wtf is _wi line 106
+ line 108 should we keep the ability to exit out of a screen capture loop? screen captures seem to take so little
time that it doesn't seem useful.
+ wtf is bRet line 119?
+ line 125 the inclusion of pixels is not necessary. I don't think the buffer is used when I give it to windows
+ lines 130 and line 159 bitmap_info and info have the exact same information. Do we need two instances.

    fn renderToBuffer
+ line 320 this function should be renamed.
    - applies a constant color to a buffer. This is not apparent from the name.
+ an option for an input color should be added

+ line 330 all static vars should be grouped together at the head of the file

    fn resizeBMP
+ add enlarge resizing
+ there needs to be an optimization pass

    fn drawBMP
+  line 394 swap hard coded rescale with rescale function
+  line 394 bypass rescale if there is no rescale option

    fn drawChar
+
